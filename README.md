# myPOAP

## The Problem

### Background

POAPs are everywhere and a lot of people own them. Here is a description from the official website [https://poap.xyz](poap.xyz):

`POAP, short for "Proof of Attendance Protocol," allows you to mint memories as digital mementos we call "POAPs." Give POAPs to people for sharing a memory with you.`

Technically, POAPs are simply NFTs on a blockchain. This means that the protocol is permissionless and composable by design. For example, someone could create a gated chat application on top of the POAP protocol to allow holders of EthGlobal POAPs to chat and interact.

However, there is a fundamental privacy issue with the way the POAP protocol is currently implemented. Specifically, for holders to prove they own a POAP issued by EthGlobal, they need to disclose their wallet address. This, in turn, exposes more information about the holders than is necessary for the chat application.

### Solutions

#### A new protocol ðŸ¤”

An obvious solution to the privacy problem is to design and implement a new protocol with privacy built into its design. While this approach might work, it would require significant duplicate engineering efforts and would need the promotion of an entirely new protocol. **And then what about all the POAPs already issued? do people then have to migrate to the new protocol?**

#### ZK to the rescue ðŸ’¯

An ideal solution would work like this: The existing POAP protocol continues to function as usual, allowing people to issue and own POAPs just as they always have. However, when a holder wants to demonstrate ownership of a POAP from a specific event, they can do so without revealing their wallet address. Additionally, applications could integrate with the privacy-preserving protocol in a permission-less manner.

**In this repository you'll find a PoC implementation of the second approach using RISC0**

## How It Works

Leveraging Risc-zero technology, zkPOAPFeedback establishes a secure and Privacy-Preserving ecosystem. Here, users can confirm their ownership of POAP tokens acquired through various events or engagements.

## Dependencies

First, [install Rust] and [Foundry], and then restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, you will need to install the `cargo risczero` tool.
We'll use [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall] to get `cargo-risczero` installed, and then install the `risc0` toolchain.
See [RISC Zero installation] for more details.

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
cargo risczero install
```

## Getting Started

### Build the Code

- Builds for zkVM program, the publisher app, and any other Rust code.

  ```sh
  cargo build
  ```

- Build your Solidity smart contracts

  > NOTE: `cargo build` needs to run first to generate the `ImageID.sol` contract.

  ```sh
  forge build
  ```

### Run the Tests

- Tests your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```

- Test your Solidity contracts, integrated with your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  RISC0_DEV_MODE=true forge test -vvv
  ```
